# CyberGRX Splunk API Connector

**Please Note** this connector has been formally tested against Splunk Enterprise version 7.2.4.

This addon enables Splunk to retrieve data from the CyberGRX customer API.  You will need a valid API token to gain access to the API and begin pulling data into Splunk.  Once data is resident in your splunk system you may enrich that data and setup alarms and custom dashboards.  The CyberGRX API is versioned and will maintain backwards compatibility. 

This is an addon that was built using the Splunk Add-on Builder.
